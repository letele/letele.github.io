            "p2": "Why view success with a contemptuous smile? Because its outcome can be futile. It may help in seeing the true potential of a process, but what is there to gain in 'seeing' only the achievable? If you experience success, be worried. Ask yourself questions such as; “Why did I not fail?”, “Where did I go right?”, “How lucky was I?” Flip the win to a loss. By doing so, not only will you see criticism as positive, but also will disdain approbation, and therefore shield success from getting in your head.",
            "p3":"Why accept rejection and embrace dislikes? Because it advocates sobriety. It maybe depressing in seeing the process as impractical, but there is a point to gain from depression. Even though you have failed dismally, embrace that failure. As terrible as the situation might be, the reality is that you are merely experiencing sobriety, and depression is only helping you see the situation crystal clear. Flip the loss to a win situation. With a sober state of mind, your inspiration is to idealize a more creative and less erroneous solution.",
            "p4":"At the end of the turmoil, it is all really about excitement. Positive excitement is appealing, but it might falsely accredit the success of a process with its effectiveness rather than its luck. Negative excitement is depressing, and depression bad as it sounds, advocates sobriety, a very useful tool in developing ideas."

            "p2":"Moses was a profound South African pianist who believed in reincarnation, and in the quote, he references Bheki Mseleku and is convinced that Bheki's talents where sharpened from a different lifetime. If you find jazz boring, then too bad man, or woman, or other. If not, listen (again if you have) to Bheki Mseleku's Celebration studio album and maybe you will get closer to the source, and catch a nostalgic feeling. It was only then, when I caught that feeling, that I understood what Moses was talking about.",
            "p3":"We are all told that hell exists, and that hell is a place where fire can never burn out. Moreover, that in hell, we will burn, but not die. The sun is scotching hot. The Sun's fire never burns out. The Sun is round like a planet. The Sun has all characteristics of hell. Therefore, the Sun is hell. Misconception: There is no life in the Sun. In every celestial body, there is consciousness, and with consciousness, life exists. Call it the soul, or energy, or life, what we know is that on Earth, consciousness is contained in an animal or a plant. Therefore, our senses and intelligence will only be limited to Earth and its environment. So just because there are no plants or animals in a celestial body, does not necessarily mean there is no conscious presence in that body.",
            "p4":"Reincarnation and the planetary system: When we die, our consciousness can only go to either, Venus, Earth, or Mars. Aggregates of our actions while on Earth dictate the designation of our consciousness. If negative, we go to Venus, closer to hell, I mean closer to the Sun. On Venus you have a chance to repent, which will be hotter, but with a second chance. If neutral, we stay on Earth, and try again, which will be more difficult as the population of Earth increases yearly, creating more unemployment and inflation. If positive, job well done, lets live in Mars. Mars, where there is no money, no religious denominations, no crazy demonstration developed by politicians, no countries and continents. No factors fueled with hate and jealousy that aim to discriminate and divide consciousness.",
            "p5":"Where is the déjà vu? It is in the back and forth. In my previous lifetime I might have behaved in Venus, or misbehaved in Mars, or did nothing on Earth. Either route, I was reincarnated with the skills I had acquired. Therefore, I think it wise to focus rather on aggregates of actions we make on the conscious containers around us, rather that feeding desires of our own container. On Earth, we are all fractions of one, and if as a fraction we do not act accordingly, then there is a dysfunctional whole."

            "p1":"Spaghetti code has no pattern. It is unique to the author and shows how ingenious the author is. Unfortunately readers cannot fully understand the logic behind the code because of its uniqueness and will always ask what the for loop in the if block does to the while condition. Readers will then try to give alternative solutions, which is where the arguments of code logic often begins. The solution has to declare what it solves, not how what is solved. You want to add 2 to each item, and not tell us you iterated through all items and added 2 on each item using the item's index value to identify its uniqueness, and ingenious approach indeed.",
            "p2":"In desperate times, we turn to regex, and come up with the following regex pattern |...| which has to identify the following characters ... as valid. If it validates true we forget about regex. After a month, we come back for code review to find |...|and ask the famous 'what the ...?' question. Luckily, regex has documentation explaining what |...| matches, answering that famous question. Spaghetti code is like regex, only its documentation is comments (if available) in its code. Comments that will not guide but misguide the reader to the wrong conclusions.",
            "p3":"Solution? Declarative programming. Declarative programming addresses what should be done over how what should be done. And because it is declarative, it somehow becomes an intuitive solution which will be understood by readers as the right approach in solving the problem. It also eliminates the need for adding comments that add more confusion as the style is self-descriptive."
