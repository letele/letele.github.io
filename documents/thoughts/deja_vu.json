        "p1": "It is not in one's lifetime that one becomes a musician - Moses Taiwa Molelekwa",
        "p2":"Moses was a profound South African pianist who believed in reincarnation, and in the quote, he references Bheki Mseleku and is convinced that Bheki's talents where sharpened from a different lifetime. If you find jazz boring, then too bad man, or woman, or other. If not, listen (again if you have) to Bheki Mseleku's Celebration studio album and maybe you will get closer to the source, and catch a nostalgic feeling. It was only then, when I caught that feeling, that I understood what Moses was talking about.",
        "p3":"We are all told that hell exists, and that hell is a place where fire can never burn out. Moreover, that in hell, we will burn, but not die. The sun is scotching hot. The Sun's fire never burns out. The Sun is round like a planet. The Sun has all characteristics of hell. Therefore, the Sun is hell. Misconception: There is no life in the Sun. In every celestial body, there is consciousness, and with consciousness, life exists. Call it the soul, or energy, or life, what we know is that on Earth, consciousness is contained in an animal or a plant. Therefore, our senses and intelligence will only be limited to Earth and its environment. So just because there are no plants or animals in a celestial body, does not necessarily mean there is no conscious presence in that body.",
        "p4":"Reincarnation and the planetary system: When we die, our consciousness can only go to either, Venus, Earth, or Mars. Aggregates of our actions while on Earth dictate the designation of our consciousness. If negative, we go to Venus, closer to hell, I mean closer to the Sun. On Venus you have a chance to repent, which will be hotter, but with a second chance. If neutral, we stay on Earth, and try again, which will be more difficult as the population of Earth increases yearly, creating more unemployment and inflation. If positive, job well done, lets live in Mars. Mars, where there is no money, no religious denominations, no crazy demonstration developed by politicians, no countries and continents. No factors fueled with hate and jealousy that aim to discriminate and divide consciousness.",
        "p5":"Where is the déjà vu? It is in the back and forth. In my previous lifetime I might have behaved in Venus, or misbehaved in Mars, or did nothing on Earth. Either route, I was reincarnated with the skills I had acquired. Therefore, I think it wise to focus rather on aggregates of actions we make on the conscious containers around us, rather that feeding desires of our own container. On Earth, we are all fractions of one, and if as a fraction we do not act accordingly, then there is a dysfunctional whole."
