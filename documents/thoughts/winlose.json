        "p1": "Accept rejection, embrace dislikes, and view success with a contemptuous smile.",
        "p2": "Why view success with a contemptuous smile? Because its outcome can be futile. It may help in seeing the true potential of a process, but what is there to gain in 'seeing' only the achievable? If you experience success, be worried. Ask yourself questions such as; “Why did I not fail?”, “Where did I go right?”, “How lucky was I?” Flip the win to a loss. By doing so, not only will you see criticism as positive, but also will disdain approbation, and therefore shield success from getting in your head.",
        "p3":"Why accept rejection and embrace dislikes? Because it advocates sobriety. It maybe depressing in seeing the process as impractical, but there is a point to gain from depression. Even though you have failed dismally, embrace that failure. As terrible as the situation might be, the reality is that you are merely experiencing sobriety, and depression is only helping you see the situation crystal clear. Flip the loss to a win situation. With a sober state of mind, your inspiration is to idealize a more creative and less erroneous solution.",
        "p4":"At the end of the turmoil, it is all really about excitement. Positive excitement is appealing, but it might falsely accredit the success of a process with its effectiveness rather than its luck. Negative excitement is depressing, and depression bad as it sounds, advocates sobriety, a very useful tool in developing ideas."
